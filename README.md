In the last nearly **8 years** I've worked by title as a modern **UI Software Engineer for web and mobile.**
Expect to see my *Backend Software Engineering skills* with Node, Python, and **Go (Preference)** and DevOps with Docker, Kubernetes, Istio, Ansible, Helm, Terraform, Jenkins, and Prometheus. As I am truly a full stack developer.

As I seek a new role due to unemployment, I founded a new tech startup, TekSrc. While I apply and interview for my next role watch me do DSA via Leetcode, build 3.0.0 of my portfolio site in NextJS, and develop a Full Stack SaaS platform web application from scratch in React, TypeScript, TanStack, TailwindCSS, Golang, PostgreSQL, Docker, & more to execute a GO-TO-MARKET Strategy.
