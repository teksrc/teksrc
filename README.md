In the last nearly 8 years I've worked by title as a modern UI Software Engineer for web and mobile.
Expect to see Backend Software Engineering with Node, Python, and Go (Preference) and DevOps with Docker, Kubernetes, Istio, Ansible, Helm, Terraform, Jenkins, and Prometheus.

Currently I'm seeking a new role, but in the meantime I have founded a tech startup, TekSrc. Currently as I apply and interview for my next role watch me do DSA via Leetcode, build 3.0.0 of my portfolio site, and a Full Stack SaaS platform web application in React, TypeScript, TanStack, TailwindCSS, Golang, PostgreSQL, Docker, & Kubernetes on my new Twitch and YouTube channels.
